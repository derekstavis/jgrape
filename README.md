JGrape
======

A simple Java GUI to learn graphs. I originally wrote JGrape in 2009 for my
(unfinished) Computer Science graduation.

Since then I never touched it. The code is not so clean, mixing Portuguese with English, no MVC concept, and more. I'm posting it here because it works 
(mostly) and it can help people.

But hey! Pull requests are welcome.
