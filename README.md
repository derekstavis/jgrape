JGrape
======

A simple Java GUI to learn graphs. I originally wrote JGrape in 2009 for my
(unfinished) Computer Science graduation.

## Working Features:

* Depth Traversal (_Profundidade_ Button)
* Breadth Traversal (_Largura_ Button)
* Number of Components (_Componentes_ Button)
* Dijsktra Algorithm

## Not Working Features:

* Fleury
* Center

Since then I never touched it. The code is not so clean, mixing Portuguese with English, no MVC concept, lots of inner classes and more to go. I'm publishing it here because it works (mostly) and can help people.

Pull requests are welcome!!
